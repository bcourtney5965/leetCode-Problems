// i: input - array
// o: ouput - number
// c: constraints - can't have multiple trades at the same time

// * notes to Zack or myself

// Instructions
// Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given 
// stock on day i.

// Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many 
// transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock 
// multiple times). However, you may not engage in multiple transactions 
// at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

// PSEUDO CODE
// some approaches
  // biggestnumber - smallestNumber
  // if i + 1 > 1 take the profti, repeat for length of array



// thoughts: 
  // seems like it should be recursive


// CODE
